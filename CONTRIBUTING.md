# Alias Web Based

A quick guide to contributing to this project.

Since this project was written for internal use at [Metropolia UAS](https://www.metropolia.fi/en), I don't expect any
issues being created here on GitHub unless something terribly wrong happened. In such case, file an issue and tag me. I
will response at my earliest convenience.
